AS A gamer who likes Final Fantasy and NeoPets
I WANT to play a video game on my computer or phone
SO THAT I can enjoy myself and experience a feeling of accomplishment

GIVEN a browser game with turn-based combat

WHEN I click on the login
THEN I am presented with a modal where I can sign up or log into my account

WHEN I click on the 'Forest' "Village' or 'Cave' area
THEN I am taken to a new area where I can interact

WHEN I click on 'recruit cat'
THEN I am prompted to name my cat

WHEN I give my cat a name
THEN that cat is added to my team

WHEN I click on 'remove cat'
THEN I can remove a cat from my team

WHEN I enter an area with combat
THEN I can engage in turn-based combat

WHEN I defeate enemies
THEN I am rewarded with experience
